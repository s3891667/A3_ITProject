      <h4 class="w3-center"><strong> OVERVIEW</strong> </h4>
      <p> It is hard to go online without reading about what the Earth has become. Humans have badly damaged our environment, which leads to many disasters. The ice in the South and North pole is melting because the planet is getting hotter each year. Many species have lost their habitat and become extinct. And the pollution is slowly killing every creature on the Earth. We are at a critical rate that if we do not act fast, more things will vanish. So it is our duty to prevent that scenario from happening. </p><br>
      <p>In an effort to contribute to global environmental conservation, Our group has developed a smartphone app that can scan and give information about animals and plants. We named our app "Bgreen" which is short for "be green".  As the name indicates itself, we want everyone to unite and protect our dear planet. Not only does the app provide a handful of knowledge of wildlife, but it is also a tool for everyone to safeguard themselves and connect with other environmental activists. </p><br>

              <p>My ideal job is senior software engineer since it fits my personality from the test and the salary is very reasonable. But to become a senior software engineer, I have to acquire a lot of skills and knowledge during my university time. So to fulfill my dream, I have set my own goal in the next few years. If there is no problem, I will earn an IT Bachelor's degree with Cloud Computing as a minor by 2023, and then I will continue studying for a master's degree. And to prepare for my future career, I will intern for a company in my second year of university. Besides learning about the technology field, I also want to improve my writing and presentation skills and leadership skills.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>An Animal Dictionary? Is it really an amazingly attractive application?</strong></h3>
            <p>In modern society, we have a language dictionary to look for new words, and an important tool to research a new language for ourselves. But have you ever come up with an idea that something can store everything about animals including living environment, food, specific information, location, special features and some amazing facts about them? </p><br>
            Imagine someone going to the zoo, exploring the rare animals in the world but finding it hard to get more information about them? And if someone wishes to have an application, just via simple steps, they can get knowledge about rare animals, especially the origin, special skill, or even mysterious complex behavior would make people admirable, the answer would be Bgreen.<br>

            <h3><strong>From the picture of COVID-19 pandemic? Why not now?</strong></h3>
              <p>Before COVID-19 happens, there is a big change in many aspects of life in a negative way. People cannot walk away; movie theaters, gyms, spas, and karaoke bars are not allowed to open at this time. Humans have to wear masks; the hospital is overloaded, and most careers become stagnant. Some scientists said that the pandemic comes from bats who store a lot of dangerous bacteria. Although it is just a theory, A warning that humans have overexploited the living environment of animals in the world would be against humans in the near future.</p><br>

                </div>
              <p>Bgreen is seen as a social media where people want to get more information about the animal world, would like to gain knowledge about wildlife, and hope to protect and preserve the space for animals, especially rare animals. Bgreen, day by day, would be able to attract more and more people to take part in the animal lover community. Bgreen, right now, is suitable to start the first steps, to make the world better, to keep the wildlife green, green in life, green in diversity.<p><br>

              <h3><strong>Project plays an important role in preventing global crisis problems.</strong></h3>
              <p>If the animal’s land disappeared, they would move to human’s living space. The bacteria also go as parasites and cause serious disease for human’s health. As a result, serious problems like COVID-19 pandemic would happen. It is hard to clarify the size and impact of the application, but it would be a typical phenomenon to demonstrate that a small thing can change big things, a small key to resolve the big situations of the world.</p><br>

          <!--5.motivation -->
              <h3><strong>Bgreen is not new, but extremely interesting.</strong></h3>
              <p>Bgreen has a community of people who have a big love for animals, share enthusiasm, emotion and opinion about wildlife. Bgreen provides hot news about red book animals, supplying great information about rare animals and emergency situations if necessary. Bgreen also provides free resources for users to exploit image, audio, video recorded from these animals for their career, studying and learning which is supplied by members of Bgreen application.</p><br>
              <p>In the near future, Bgreen will also have a place for animal rights organizations, to viral strong messages, to create awareness to the young generation, and motivate people to save the wildlife via specific activities based on different countries and areas. Moreover, Bgreen is also considered to get the attention from UNICEF to be officially recognized as a global application, to make Bgreen really an online platform about animals for the users.</p><br>
          <!--6.motivation -->
              <h3><strong>Who will be the future employer?</strong></h3>
              <p>The developer team considers Bgreen is an application of community. Like Facebook, the people would decide what the application would be. If they want Bgreen change in some way to make it suitable in the next century, we will do that. Bgreen was born for the human, and the human would be the future employer of this application. The developer just made the dream come true.
              To clarify, If successful, Bgreen would be developed as a revenue source in the stock market. Henceforth, Bgreen develops or disappears based on the attention of the global community.

          <!--7.motivation -->
              <h3><strong>Create a community for environmental activists. </strong></h3>
              <p>Finally, we want to create a community for environmental activists. It is a place for everyone with the same interest to express themselves and share their experience. Even though there are many voluntary organizations, it is hard for everyone to update the news. By creating a social platform, organizations can post their activity and invite people to join. Moreover, the app will also support the organizer by counting participants or setting a notification when the event occurs. As a result, more people will know about the activity and more people will participate in it. A big community for eco-friendly users is what is missing in Vietnam.</p>

              <h3 class="w3-center"><strong> Landscape</strong> </h3>
              <p>Image recognition is not new in the IT world, and many apps use this feature. At first, we did not know any app similar to Bgreen, but a team member accidentally came across iNaturalist, and both apps share some identical functions. So to have a better view of our competitor, we decided to try this app. So what is iNaturalist? It is an online social network to help people share knowledge about biodiversity and educate people about the environment. Both iNaturalist and Bgreen have the same goal to help people understand the environment. They both have an image recognition function to give information about every species. But in iNaturalist, the machine cannot fully recognize a species; it provides the user a list of similar species then the user can go online and ask others to confirm it. Our Bgreen will ensure that the app can recognize the species up to 99%. We will train the Machine Learning, feed them with a vast database, and allow users to contribute to it. We can eliminate the wrong answer, and the machine can recognize the species more easily. </p><br>

              </div>
              <p>We also have an emergency function to alarm the authority when the user is in danger. As for the community, its sole purpose is to give information about the wildlife, while Bgreen provides the user with many activities and helpful knowledge. Even though INaturalist is a very well-built application, not many users use it. Because they lack marketing for the app and many the app does not make available in many regions which cause the app's popularity low. Some users even have problems signing up for an account or entering the app, contributing to the low popularity. But we have to acknowledge that the app's sound detecting feature is unique while having a few errors when using it. </p>

            <h3><strong>Goal 1: Create an exciting yet user-friendly app for everyone. </strong></h3>
            <p>Our ultimate goal is to create an app that helps people understand the environment and join us in a journey to protect our dear planet. The design must be attractive while everyone can understand it. If the app is hard to use or not appealing, we will lose many users, and the project will fail immediately. We also expect a lot of elders and children to use our app. By using the green theme color to represent nature and using a simple user interface, we hope that Bgreen can fit every user. Users can also change the color and font in the setting.</p><br>

            </div>
            <!--goal 2 -->
            <h3><strong>Goal 2: Having a good marketing strategy: </strong></h3>
            <p>Because our app involves a lot of group activity, so attract many users is very crucial. We need a lot of people to contribute to our DataBase and build a community. Some events and apps support environmentalists but lack a good marketing strategy, which leads to low popularity, and the app fails to attract more users. We want Bgreen to be widely used and build a vast eco-friendly community, so we need to plan carefully to achieve our goal.</p>
            <p> First, we will do as many voluntary activities as possible to promote our app. We will also provide support for the organization to see the benefit of using Bgreen and help us promote our product. But overall, it is the quality that matters, so having a unique and unforgettable app can help us achieve our goal.</p><br>
            <!--goal 3 -->
            <h3><strong> Goal 3: Finding sponsors and cooperate with the government:</strong></h3>
            <p>Since we have a Reward section to encourage users to do voluntary work, finding sponsors can help us build a community. By assisting organizations through the app, organizations can prepare little gifts or certificates to encourage users. We also want to cooperate with the government to educate others in protecting rare species. It is also a way to help our planet become better because many people are still not aware of our current situation, which leads to the extinction of some species. And someone might accidentally harm themselves by eating poisonous plants or attack by deadly animals. So having enough knowledge can be helpful.</p><br>
            <!--goal 4 -->
            <h3><strong>Goal 4: Security for the app </strong></h3>
            <p>When building an application, cyber security should never be overlooked. As users are trusting and giving us their personal information, we have to ensure that the information is secure and safe so that everyone can trust the app and continue to use our services. So having a good security system can prevent others from stealing information or losing the data.</p><br>

            <p>After forming a group, our team members make a meeting and conduct a review of the potential project. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we consider projects that are built on the online platform. To review the period 2015-2021, The human has spent a more difficult time because of COVID-19 pandemic, Deforestation in Amazon (Brazil), Us, and Australia. Another point, the strength and bad impact of natural disasters have become more serious, and the reasons which mostly come from human activities. </p><br>
            <p>Being the human of the 21st century, our team members decide to choose Hao’s project whose applications and functions focus on protecting and preserving the animal ecosystem, raise awareness about wildlife, connect the animal lover community, and viral messages and slogans for a better world shortly.</p><br>
            <p>Overview, Bgreen Application is not out of our ability, and It is suitable to conduct during the COVID-19 pandemic that there is no best prediction for new normal status. On the other hand, although the team members are first-year students, they have the basic foundation knowledge to apply Web and Application technology to perform this project. Meanwhile, the 5- year progress for new functions in the future would be considered as our team member’s skills and knowledge would increase over time.</p><br>
            <p>Moreover, The Application towards social media, meaning motivates users to take part in the application as much as possible. As a result, the technology our project need is cloud computing, a concept of Big Data, Virtual Reality for scanning function of Animal Dictionary, and Artificial Intelligence to write algorithms based on users’ trends.</p><br>

              <h3><strong>Building Websites via HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and framework (Bootstrap, Vues) </strong></h3>
              <p>First, we can do a website, the first perfect place to research, conduct, and develop for other platforms. To do this, we have to understand how the website works, meaning we have to use material such as User-centered design, UI/ UX prototype, and large size feedback on how users understand and show their interactions in this project. After that, the team members must have strong knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a website, the framework is also studied based on an effective response interface from the result of UI/ UX User feedback. </p><br>
              <h3> <strong>  Converting the website into application by using Appy Pie, HTMl5, CSS3</strong></h3>
              <p>We would spend half of the year accomplishing the website. However, IT Technology allows us to convert code from websites into other platforms like IOS, Android platforms for reducing working process time via Appy Pie, especially HTML version 5 and CSS version 3 also help the developers to optimize the layout during the writing code. Overview, in this working process, we would the rest of the year, the most time for this process focus on user feedback and provide trial versions, debugging, and updating functions of the application.</p><br>

              <p>During this period, the working process shows us how to identify the timeframe to ensure the flow of the work, forecast technology would help members how long the application's functions are accomplished? This technology is very beneficial and important for the developer to forecast the time for releasing version, especially emergency functions that need specific deadlines based on the user's requirement. On the other hand, we do not know that the risk may happen, forecast software technology also keep time for these problems.</p><br>

              <p>AI visual studio code is published at this time, to increase the speed in writing code, the developers like us can use this technology to debug and develop products or work on outsourcing. By AI, the code would be automatically written to reduce the time for this working process. In other words, the developer is able to spend more to come up with creative ideas or solutions, and they spend less time to perform the ideas and solutions practically.</p><br>

              <h3><strong>Period 2: Updating function in more detail including cloud computing, User group development, social media, Video, and Chat Box- In-progress</strong> </h3>
              <h3><strong>Big Data- Cloud Computing technology</strong></h3>
              <p>Before this period, the developers provided images, information for animal scanning, animal dictionary, and social media is not more popular. Next, the number of users will increase, which will make us use cloud computing technology. This technology provides storation solutions for technology platforms, and the user just spends money for the space they utilize. As mentioned in Tool and Technology, cloud computing is used for the huge data from users, resources from social media and other functions, reducing risks of losing data.</p><br>

              <h3><strong>Video via Dreamweaver technology</strong> </h3>
              <p>Although Dreamweaver software is popular for editing images for website’s layout, the users would prefer animation, like a kind of video which is created from a lot of stunning images, this helps users be able to view all the content by just using a click. However, this technology is available for the developers to provide animation functions, view only is available for users.</p>
              <p>In the future, Bgreen can adopt Dreamweaver as a function for users to create animation like a short video from the images, pictures they share on Bgreen animal social media.</p><br>
              <h3><strong>Chatbox- User group </strong></h3>
              <p>Chatbox is always necessary for an application to connect the users, provide more space for them to respond and request in each other. Indeed, they have more space to discuss, share anything about related animal topics excluding posts, content, and community which are available on social media.</p>

              <h3><strong>Period 3: Advanced Development for user’s demand including Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, and External Association- Future Development. </strong></h3>
              <h3><strong>Artificial Intelligence </strong></h3>
              <p>There is a reason why we consider Artificial Intelligence, Optimize performance for better user experience, and releasing commercial solutions. The algorithms will be researched and developed to measure the user’s behavior, activities, how they interact with others and the habit to view while using the application. The technology helps users find out the resources they need in the shortest time, this is not a risk to limit using time, and enhance user experience.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, the application needs strong financial resources to develop, and we learned that free resources are not available over time, meaning we would collect and analyze the data from users (no private information) to release advertisements for business’s demand to attract related groups of users. </p><br>

              <h3><strong> Virtual Reality technology </strong></h3>


              <p>Virtual Technology is developing dramatically, this technology helps us have a virtual platform such as glasses, hand-on via hardware setup. This is not new but looks quite challenging for us to develop. The application from devices would be the resources to provide wildlife, realistic animals like the user is taking part in a zoo, a forest, or somewhere in the home of the animal.</p><br>

              <h3><strong>External Association- Ecosystem diversity: </strong></h3>
              <p>The application is developed but increasing new functions should be considered. So, providing another application which stays in the same ecosystem is a smart solution. Google ecosystem including Youtube, Google Chrome, Google drive, Email meanwhile Facebook ecosystem including Instagram, Messenger. It is very beneficial to get more users, increase financial value, and develop the size in many aspects, which is originally come from a small application</p><br>

              <h3><strong>SOFTWARE </strong></h3>
              <h3><strong> Semantic Segmentation based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong></h3>
              <p>BGreen is the tool that helps users to identify plants and creatures in nature in terms of learning and exploring; Therefore, we will choose the technology called Semantic Segmentation based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which is known as image classification and object detection, furthermore, is to overcome the limitations of Semantic Segmentation then apply those in the application. This technology allows the application to analyze images in order to identify the types of creatures based on the database that we have created. Moreover, with the art of this technology, users can scan the moving objects for example wild animals with a high accuracy and speed.  </p><br>

              <h3><strong>Cloud Computing</strong></h3>
              <p>“Bgreen" application mentions functions like social media, and our team would consider the importance of cloud computing. Today, cloud computing technology has become more popular and plays an important role in the IT industry. This method is able to store the data for users via a virtual platform, providing safe solutions, compared to traditional methods such as USB, CPU’s RAM and ROM. Asa result, situations such as broken hardware would not affect the restoration of cloud computing. Moreover, the users’ data is huge (Big Data), so, Cloud computing is an effective option for future breakthroughs. </p><br>

              <h3><strong> Flutter</strong></h3>
              <p>Since we want to provide the service for every type of user; Therefore, we have considered aiming for the two most common mobile operating systems, that are IOS and Android. In this situation, Flutter is our choice when the tool allows us to develop an application on both two operating systems. We will code the whole application by using C/C++. During the first steps, we use Figma as a tool to create a prototype as well as design UI/UX for the application before coding to complete the final form for our product.</p><br>

              <h3><strong> Visual studio code and Atom</strong></h3>
              <p>During the project, our coding team will utilize Visual studio and Atom and connect with repositories on GitHub in order to code CSS/HTML files for the project website. Plus, another tool which is Git Bash will be used to push and pull all the updates while coding for the project.</p>
              <p>Overall, BGreen has the ambition to create an ecosystem containing a community for those who love animals to participate in. The main purpose is raising youngsters’ awareness to protect nature due to massive damage caused by human activities during XXI decade. Therefore, we will not use hardware to host servers for BGreen, instead in terms of further development in the future we consider using server hosting services from Amazon to increase the safety as well as capacity of our servers. About the coding process, we utilize many coding languages to design a website from scratch including the application itself, such as C/C++ and HTML/CSS. In addition, we must do deep research, learning about segmentation with CNNS to generate better quality for BGreen in the future. </p><br>

              <!--testing-->
              <h3 class="w3-center"><strong> Testing</strong></h3>
              <p>Due to the severe situation caused by COVID-19, we have to take online courses at RMIT; Therefore, we will test our products by using a tool called Figma. We will design a prototype by using Figma, each of us will design individually then send these prototypes for each member to test and discuss in detail. During our last course, three of us have taken User-centred design, which taught us how to create complete products by prototyping. Furthermore, we are able to apply step by step the progress in order to generate as high usability as we can. </p>
              <p>Specifically, after finishing further development for the project, we will design UX/UI for our application. Firstly, we will have a conversation discussing how the styles as well as contents of the products should be. After we have chosen, each member will draw a paper prototype to outline the ideas and we send it to the UX/UI design team to develop it, and the team has two members Si Phu and Viet Hao. Our group wants to make sure that the application is user friendly and furthermore is attractive and efficient while using. Finally, we will send the link of the product’s prototype to our friends, family to receive feedback in order to know whether it is easy to use or not. Plus, we will also focus on how the users interact with the application, for example misunderstandings and struggles.</p>
              <p>After that, we will ask them to address those difficulties in detail in the project google forms to know how they feel about the Bgreen. From that, the whole team will have a final meeting to conclude to make adjustments, improvements with the purpose to create better experiences for the users.</p><br>

              <!--risks -->
              <h3 class="w3-center"> <strong> Risks </strong></h3>
              <p>In the process of making this mobile app, there are many risks that we could encounter such as technologies and quarantine due to pandemic’s outbreak. Still, we are trying our best to complete the project before the deadline published on canvas.  </p>
              <p>First, the app requires scanning the picture or the real-life creatures to analyze and access to the database. Hence, if the weather is affecting the quality of the camera, the scanner can make a mistake in identifying the creature. For example, if the scanned animal is a toxic and dangerous snake but covered in mud or the rain affects the quality of the camera, the final decision could be a friendly and cute snake. This is so dangerous if the users are children who lack experience and are curious about everything. </p>
              <p>Second is about the credibility of databases for all animal species in the world. The collecting data could take many years to complete, and the trust level of information is a challenge for examination and integration. In detail, the information of biology in Vietnam is limited at the moment(Vietnam National Biodiversity Database System n.d) that provides simple information of species and even lacks descriptive images.</p>
              <p>Third, the feature calling to the nearest medical institution could be under-estimate by users. For example, whether the users will let the animal harm their health after they scan and understand its danger. In other cases, if users were bitten, will they have enough attention and consciousness to open the app and dial, or they just need to call 115 or 911. </p>
              <p>According to the group of researchers from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH, Korea, with the combination of CNNs, the accuracy of the method will only reach 72.5% which remains a moderate percent of effectiveness scale to our expectations. Due to the external factors the system may not analyze as well as identify a species properly. Therefore, we expect to develop this technology as effectively as we can in terms of providing the best experiences for the users during their research, learning activities. Which also means that we will need to put more effort into implementing, improving the algorithms for a long period of time. </p>
              <p>Not only do we have to develop CNNs for segmentation, but also become expertise in many coding languages and tools. To create a complete product involves servers, technologies, community, applications, and many other things. We have to work on many kinds of languages such as C/C++, HTML/CSS and for further development, Python and MySQL will also be applied for BGreen.</p>
              <p>Currently, we have to encounter an inevitable situation which is the pandemic outbreak. It has caused us to study online, which leads to lack of meetings and clear discussions about our project. Therefore, explaining as well as describing each one’s idea usually consumes most of the time, since some members have difficulties in addressing the idea in words (they are used to drawing on paper). Furthermore, quarantine has led to internet overload, since the community is mainly active online during these days, so it affects the quality of our online meetings. For example, lag and delay while communicating with other people. </p><br>

              <!--communincations -->
              <h3 class="w3-center"><strong> Group processes and communications</strong></h3>
              <p>Team meeting: 1h30 each three days for catching up workflow and plan for the next section. Team communication: We have used Facebook Messenger and Teams for chatting and transferring information and working updating. The messenger is used to communicate every time any problem or question occurs while working which connects team members in fixing small problems and improves responsiveness of the whole team. </p>
              <p>Furthermore, the Teams application is helpful when the work needs to be discussed with visuals. Instead of face-to-face meetings, the online environment boosts team working ability continuously and the workflow is easier to be catches up and improves performance with visual meetings. If one or more members of the team miss the scheduled meetings, we try to contact him by other applications like personal calls. If that member is not available, the meeting note would be produced and sent directly to him to arrange new work or notice about the meeting’s highlights. </p><br>
